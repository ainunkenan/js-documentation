          JavaScript is a powerful and versatile programming language that plays
          a pivotal role in the world of web development.<br />
          <strong>In 1995</strong>, JavaScript was created by
          <strong>Brendan Eich</strong> in just ten days while working at
          Netscape Communications. Initially known as <em>"Mocha"</em> it was
          later renamed <em>"LiveScript"</em> before finally becoming
          JavaScript.<br />Its purpose was to add client-side interactivity to
          web pages, and it was first introduced in the Netscape Navigator
          browser.
        </p>
        <p class="section-content">
          Recognizing the need for a standardized version of the language,
          Netscape submitted JavaScript to the Ecma International organization.
          This led to the first <strong>ECMAScript</strong> standard, published
          in <strong>1997</strong>. <br />ECMAScript is the formal specification
          for JavaScript. JavaScript's popularity grew rapidly, but it faced
          compatibility issues due to competing browser vendors implementing the
          language differently.<br />This period, known as the "browser wars,"
          marked significant advancements in JavaScript capabilities and
          performance.
        </p>
        <p class="section-content">
          JavaScript became a crucial part of the Web 2.0 movement. Technologies
          like <em>Asynchronous JavaScript</em> and <em>XML (AJAX)</em> allowed
          for seamless data exchange between the client and server, ushering in
          an era of dynamic and interactive web applications.
        </p>
        <p class="section-content">
          JavaScript became an integral part of the HTML5 standard, allowing for
          new capabilities like the HTML5 Canvas, Web Workers, and the
          Geolocation API. These additions revolutionized web development,
          making it possible to create complex applications entirely in the
          browser.
        </p>
        <p class="section-content">
          JavaScript saw the emergence of powerful front-end and back-end
          frameworks, such as <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>React</strong>,
          and <strong>Vue.js</strong> for client-side development, and
          <strong>Express.js</strong> for server-side development with
          <strong>Node.js</strong>. These frameworks streamlined the development
          process and offered robust solutions for building modern web
          applications.
        </p>
        <p class="section-content">
          <strong>ECMAScript 6 (ES6)</strong> was a significant update to
          JavaScript, introducing new syntax and features that enhanced the
          language's expressiveness and maintainability. Subsequent ECMAScript
          releases have continued to add features and improvements.
        </p>
        <p class="section-content">
          Today, JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages
          globally, powering not only web applications but also mobile apps
          (through frameworks like <strong>React Native</strong>) and even
          desktop applications. Its extensive ecosystem, active community, and
          continuous evolution make it a fundamental tool for developers in the
          ever-evolving world of technology.

          JavaScript vs Java,<br />Unraveling the Differences
        </h2>
        <p class="section-content">
          JavaScript and Java, despite their similar names, are two distinct
          programming languages with different purposes, use cases, and
          characteristics.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li class="section-content">Purpose and Use Cases:</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript is primarily a client-side
              scripting language used for enhancing web pages. It allows
              developers to create interactive and dynamic content in web
              browsers. JavaScript is essential for tasks such as form
              validation, animations, and modifying the Document Object Model
              (DOM) on web pages.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>Java:</strong> Java is a versatile, general-purpose
              programming language that can be used for a wide range of
              applications, including web development, desktop software, mobile
              apps, and backend systems. It is often used for building Android
              mobile applications, enterprise-level applications, and
              large-scale, server-side applications.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <li class="section-content">Language Type:</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript is a dynamically typed,
              interpreted language. It does not require compilation and is
              executed directly in the browser.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>Java:</strong> Java is a statically typed language, which
              means that type checking is performed at compile time. Java code
              is compiled into bytecode, which runs on the Java Virtual Machine
              (JVM).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <li class="section-content">Syntax and Semantics:</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript's syntax is inspired by C
              and C++, but it also has functional programming features. It has a
              flexible and forgiving syntax, making it accessible for beginners.
              It supports event-driven, asynchronous programming, which is
              crucial for web development.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>Java:</strong> Java's syntax is more rigid and verbose
              compared to JavaScript. It follows a more traditional
              object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm and enforces strong
              typing and explicit declarations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <li class="section-content">Ecosystem and Libraries:</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of
              libraries and frameworks, including jQuery, React, Angular, and
              Vue.js for front-end development, and Node.js for server-side
              development. This rich ecosystem simplifies and accelerates web
              and application development.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>Java:</strong> Java also boasts a robust ecosystem with
              numerous libraries and frameworks. Popular Java frameworks include
              Spring for web applications and Hibernate for database access. It
              is widely used in enterprise environments.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <li class="section-content">Platform and Runtime:</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript runs within web browsers,
              making it a client-side language. However, with Node.js, it can
              also be used on the server-side.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>Java:</strong> Java applications are typically compiled
              into bytecode that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This
              enables Java to be platform-independent, as long as there is a
              compatible JVM for the target platform.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <li class="section-content">Learning Curve:</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript is often considered more
              accessible to beginners due to its forgiving nature (e.g
              dynamically typed, etc) and extensive online resources for
              learning.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>Java:</strong> Java's learning curve can be steeper,
              particularly for those new to programming. Its static typing and
              OOP principles may require more upfront knowledge and effort to
              master.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
        <p class="section-content">
          While JavaScript and Java share a name and some syntactical
          similarities, they serve different purposes and have distinct
          characteristics. JavaScript is the go-to language for web development
          and enhancing user interfaces, while Java is a versatile language used
          in a wide array of applications, from mobile apps to enterprise-level
          software.

      <section id="variables">
        <h2 class="section-title">Variables</h2>
        <p class="section-content">
          Variables are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, as in most
          programming languages. They act as containers for storing and managing
          data within your scripts. JavaScript variables are versatile, allowing
          you to work with various types of data, change their values, and use
          them in calculations and logical operations.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-heading">Declaring Variables:</h3>
        <p class="section-content">
          In JavaScript, you can declare variables using three keywords:
          <strong>var</strong>, <strong>let</strong>, and
          <strong>const</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="section-content">
            <strong>var</strong>: Historically, var was the primary way to
            declare variables in JavaScript. Variables declared with var, are
            either function-scoped or global-scoped. They are visible through
            blocks.
          </li>
          <li class="section-content">
            <strong>let</strong>: Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), let provides
            block-level scope, making it a better choice for declaring variables
            within blocks, such as loops and conditional statements. Variables
            declared with let can be reassigned.
          </li>
          <li class="section-content">
            <strong>const</strong>: Also introduced in ES6, const is used to
            declare constants, which are variables with values that cannot be
            changed after assignment. Like let, const also has block-level
            scope.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="section-heading">Variable Naming Rules:</h3>
        <p class="section-content">
          In JavaScript, variable names are subject to specific naming rules and
          conventions. Adhering to these rules ensures your code is readable,
          maintainable, and less error-prone.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="section-content">
            Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning
            <strong>myName</strong> and <strong>myname</strong> are
            <em>considered distinct variables</em>.
          </li>
          <li class="section-content">
            The first character must be a letter, an underscore, or a dollar
            sign.
          </li>
          <li class="section-content">
            Variable names can consist of letters, digits, underscores (_), and
            dollar signs ($).
          </li>
          <li class="section-content">
            JavaScript has reserved words, also known as keywords, that cannot
            be used as variable names. These reserved words are part of the
            language's syntax and have predefined meanings. Examples include
            <strong>if</strong>, <strong>else</strong>, <strong>while</strong>,
            <strong>function</strong>, and others. You cannot use these as
            variable names.
          </li>
          <li class="section-content">
            Variable names should be descriptive and convey the purpose of the
            variable. Meaningful variable names make your code more
            understandable and maintainable.<br /><br />
            For example, instead of using <strong>x</strong> or
            <strong>a</strong> as a variable name, use something like
            <strong>totalPrice</strong> or
            <strong>userAge</strong>
            to indicate what the variable represents.<br />Avoid using single
            letters, such as <strong>i</strong>, <strong>j</strong>, or
            <strong>x</strong>, as variable names for non-trivial variables.
            Single-letter variable names can be confusing and should be reserved
            for loop counters in short loops.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li class="section-content">
            JavaScript developers often use two common conventions for naming
            variables: camelCase and snake_case.
            <ul>
              <li class="sub-section-content">
                <em>CamelCase</em> : the first word is in lowercase, and
                subsequent words begin with uppercase letters. For example:
                <strong>myVariableName</strong> or <strong>userName</strong>.
              </li>
              <li class="sub-section-content">
                <em>Snake_case</em> : words are separated by underscores. For
                example: <strong>my_variable_name</strong> or
                <strong>user_name</strong>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="section-content">
            Constants are often named in ALL_CAPS with underscores, such as
            <strong>MAX_VALUE</strong> or <strong>PI</strong>. This naming
            convention indicates that the value should not be changed after
            assignment.
          </li>
          <li class="section-content">
            It's a good practice to include a data type hint in your variable
            names. For instance, if a variable stores a date, you can include
            "date" in the name, such as <strong>startDate</strong> or
            <strong>endDate</strong>.
          </li>
          <li class="section-content">
            While JavaScript allows some special characters in variable names,
            it's best to avoid them to maintain code clarity and avoid potential
            issues. Stick to letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="section-heading">Assigning Values:</h3>
        <p class="section-content">
          You can assign values to variables during declaration or later in your
          code.<br />For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-js">
let user_age = 28; // Declaration and assignment
let userName; // Declaration without assignment
userName = "Kenan"; // Assignment after declaration
          </code>
        </pre>
      </section>
      <div class="div"></div>
      <section id="var-scope">
        <h2 class="section-title">Variables Scope</h2>
        <p class="section-content">
          In JavaScript, the scope of a variable refers to the region or context
          in which that variable is accessible and can be used. The scope of a
          variable is determined by how and where it is declared.<br />There are
          two main types of variable scope in JavaScript: global scope and local
          (or function) scope.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li class="section-content">Global Scope</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="section-content">
              Variables declared outside of any function or block have global
              scope. They are accessible from anywhere in the JavaScript code,
              both inside and outside functions.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              Be cautious with global variables, as they can lead to naming
              conflicts and make it harder to track variable changes in large
              applications. They should be used sparingly and for values that
              genuinely need to be accessible globally.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="section-content">Example of a global variable:</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
var globalVar = 10;
function myFunc () {
  // globalVar is accessible here
  console.log(globalVar);
}

myFunc(); // Outputs 10
console.log(globalVar); // Outputs 10
            </code>
          </pre>
          <li class="section-content">Local (Function) Scope</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="section-content">
              Variables declared within a function have local scope, meaning
              they are only accessible within that function.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              Local scope also applies to variables declared within block
              statements, such as if statements or loops, when using
              <strong>let</strong> or <strong>const</strong>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="section-content">Example of a local variable:</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
function myFunc () {
  var localVar = 10; // localVar is locally scoped
  console.log(localVar);
}
            
myFunc(); // Outputs 10
console.log(localVar); // ReferenceError: localVar is not defined
            </code>
          </pre>
          <li class="section-content">Block Scope</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="section-content">
              In modern JavaScript, variables declared with
              <strong>let</strong> and <strong>const</strong> have block-level
              scope. This means they are confined to the block in which they are
              declared, whether it's a function, if statement, loop, or any
              other block.

        <p class="section-content">
          The <strong>var</strong> keyword was the primary way to declare
          variables in JavaScript for a long time.<br />However, with the
          introduction of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and the availability of
          <strong>let</strong> and <strong>const</strong>, there are strong
          reasons to let go of the <strong>var</strong> keyword and embrace the
          newer variable declaration options.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="section-heading">The Problem With Var</h3>
        <ol>
          <li class="section-content">No Block Scope</li>
          <p class="section-content">
            Variables declared with <strong>var</strong>, are either
            function-scoped or global-scoped. They are visible through
            blocks.<br />For Example :
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
if (true) {
  var fruit = "Grape";
}

console.log(fruit); // Outputs Grape, the variable lives after if
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="section-content">
            As <strong>var</strong> ignores code blocks, we've got a global
            variable fruit. But if we used <strong>let fruit</strong> instead of
            <strong>var fruit</strong>, then the variable would only be visible
            inside <strong>if</strong>.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
if (true) {
  let fruit = "Grape";
}

console.log(fruit); // ReferenceError: fruit is not defined
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="section-content">Another example :</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
for (var i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++) {
  var one = 1;
  //....
}

console.log(i); // 10, "i" is visible after loop, it's a global variable
console.log(one); // 1, "one" is visible after loop, it's a global variable
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="section-content">
            As we can see, <strong>var</strong> pierces through
            <strong>if</strong>, <strong>for</strong> or other code blocks.
            That's because a long time ago in JavaScript, blocks had no Lexical
            Environments, and <strong>var</strong> is a remnant of that time.
          </p>
          <li class="section-content">Tolerates Re-declaration</li>
          <p class="section-content">
            We can redeclare a variable any number of times with
            <strong>var</strong>.<br />For Example : <br />
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
var name = "Kenan";
var name = "Kenny"; // the "name" variable is being redeclared
// ...it doesn't trigger an error

console.log(name); // Kenny
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="section-content">
            But if we declare the same variable with <strong>let</strong> twice,
            an error happened :
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
let name = "Kenan";
let name = "Kenny"; // SyntaxError: 'name' has already been declared
            </code>
          </pre>
          <li class="section-content">Declared below their use</li>
          <p class="section-content">
            <strong>var</strong> declarations are processed when the function
            starts (or script starts for globals).<br />In other words,
            <strong>var</strong> variables are defined from the beginning of the
            function, no matter where the definition is (assuming that the
            definition is not in the nested function).<br />Example :<br />
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
function sayHi () {
  name = "Kenan";
  console.log ("Hi" + " " + name);
  var name;
}

sayHi(); // Output Hi Kenan
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="section-content">
            While, if we do the same with <strong>let</strong> :
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
function sayHi () {
  name = "Kenan";
  console.log ("Hi" + " " + name);
  let name;
}
                
sayHi(); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'name' before initialization
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="section-content">
            People also call such behavior <em>“hoisting”</em> (raising),
            because all <strong>var</strong> are <em>“hoisted”</em> (raised) to
            the top of the function.<br />But, it is important to notice, while
            the <strong>declarations</strong> are <em>“hoisted”</em>, the
            <strong>assignments</strong> are not.<br />For Example :<br />
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
function sayHi () {
  console.log ("Hi" + " " + name);
  var name = "Kenan";
}
                
sayHi(); // Output Hi undefined
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="section-content">
            The line <strong>var name = "Kenan";</strong> has two action in it
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li class="section-content">
              Variable Declaration : <strong>var name</strong>
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              Variable Assignment : <strong>= "Kenan"</strong>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="section-content">Another Example :</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
function sayHi () {
  console.log ("Hi" + " " + name); // Hi undefined
  var name; // declaration is being “hoisted”..
  name = "Kenan"; // ..assignment works when the execution reaches it
}

sayHi(); // Output Hi undefined
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p class="section-content">
            Because all <strong>var</strong> declarations are processed at the
            function start (<em>“hoisted”</em>), we can reference them at any
            place. <br />But variables are <em>undefined</em> until the
            assignments.<br /><br />In both examples above, the code runs
            without an error, because the variable name exists.<br />But its
            value is not yet assigned, so it shows <em>undefined</em>.
          </p>
          <p class="section-content">
            In summary, the <strong>var</strong> keyword in JavaScript has been
            largely replaced by <strong>let</strong> and
            <strong>const</strong> due to their block-level scoping, the
            prevention of hoisting-related issues, and improved code
            predictability.
          </p>
          <p class="section-content">
            By embracing <strong>let</strong> and <strong>const</strong>, we can
            write cleaner, more maintainable, and less error-prone JavaScript
            code.<br />It's advisable to transition away from
            <strong>var</strong> in modern JavaScript development.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Data Types</h2>
        <p class="section-content">
          Data types are fundamental building blocks in any programming
          language, including JavaScript. They define the kind of data that can
          be stored and manipulated in your JavaScript code.<br />Understanding
          data types is essential for writing effective and error-free
          JavaScript programs.<br />In JavaScript, data types are categorized
          into two main groups: primitive data types and reference data types.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li class="section-content">Primitive Data Types</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>Number</strong>: Represents both integers and
              floating-point numbers.<br />Examples: <strong>42</strong>,
              <strong>3.14</strong>.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>String</strong>: Represents sequences of characters,
              enclosed in single (<strong>' '</strong>), double (<strong
                >" "</strong
              >), or backticks (<strong>` `</strong>) quotes.<br />
              Examples: <strong>'Hello, world!'</strong>,
              <strong>"JavaScript"</strong>.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>Boolean</strong>: Represents true or false values.<br />Examples:
              <strong>true</strong>, <strong>false</strong>.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>Undefined</strong>: Represents a variable that has been
              declared but has not been assigned a value.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>Null</strong>: Represents the absence of a value. It is
              often used to explicitly indicate that a variable is empty or has
              no value.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>Symbol (ES6 and later)</strong>: Represents unique and
              immutable values. Symbols are often used as object property keys.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <li class="section-content">Reference Data Types</li>
          <p class="section-content">
            Reference data types are more complex and can hold multiple values
            and methods. They are mutable, which means their contents can be
            changed. JavaScript has three primary reference data types.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>Object</strong>: Objects are complex data structures that
              can store key-value pairs. Objects can be used to represent a wide
              range of data, from simple data structures to more complex
              entities like arrays, functions, and custom data types.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>Array</strong>: Arrays are a specific type of object used
              to store ordered collections of values. Elements in an array can
              be of any data type and are accessed by their index.
            </li>
            <li class="section-content">
              <strong>Function</strong>: Functions are also objects in
              JavaScript. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments
              to other functions, and returned as values. Functions are used to
              define reusable blocks of code.
